                  Hi this is Sumanth Valiveti. I think this is best website to
                  learn the online courses I have ever seen. In this we had a
                  good conversation with mentors and the teaching skills were
                  awesome and they were allowed us to contact them for any doubt
                  and at any time and this might won't happen many times as
                  their teaching was very good and we understood each and every
                  bit. They used to teach us as we want and they made some
                  boring topics into very much intrested. It will be much worth
                  for each rupee you paid and it also not costs too much. I am
                  too much satisfied with this and the courses they provide will
                  be so usefull for our future.

                  My name is Reshma S. I am currently doing B.E. Electronics and
                  Communication Engineering. I encountered Skill Safari randomly
                  through a webinar which they had organized. I have attended
                  many workshops and online webinars but what attracted me to
                  Skill Safari and encouraged me to take up their program is
                  their ability to connect to students instantly through their
                  webinars. They help us acquire the skills needed in today's
                  corporate world and constantly encourage us to come out of our
                  comfort zone and try everything new through their programs.
                  The mentors do a great job in helping the students in every
                  way possible. This is what I liked about their programs as it
                  helped students like me a lot.

                  The teaching from the beginning was carried out in the most
                  professional and friendly way. The trainers were very involved
                  in helping me out with doubts at every time. They also
                  acknowledged my work and helped me improve my skills. On the
                  whole Great Team, I feel great satisfaction in learning under
                  you guys and glad that every penny that I spent is worth the
                  knowledge that you guys provided me. Its completely rare to
                  have friendly trainers, thats the most important factor that
                  you guys excelled in

                  I got to know about skill safari from my college mentor and
                  I'm very thankful for that. Basically I wasn't a computer
                  student in my schooling and puc, and I lacked self confidence,
                  but from this program to which I enrolled with skill safari
                  gave me self confidence and most importantly I gained a lot of
                  interest in computers and forever thankful for it. I wish all
                  the best to the skill safari team in all the future
                  endeavours.

                  I really enjoyed the online course. I thought it was well
                  planned and layed out, easy for me to follow. The work
                  load(Assignments) was just enough, so i could finish
                  everything with enough time, learn about the topics and not
                  feel over loaded and rushed. All trainers are teaching very
                  well, all the classes are interactive if we get any dauts they
                  will clear during live classes, and we have mentors we can
                  contact them to clarify any dauts,we also get recorded videos
                  so that we can watch the classes again. Overall I really like
                  this course and it's not like normal college classes, it's an
                  hands on session so not at all boring it's very interesting to
                  learn. We will be doing projects as we learn something ,so we
                  are implementing what we have learned so that it makes me more
                  confident about what I have learnt. Heartly thank you to all
                  the trainers of Skills Safari.

                  Iam so happy to share my experience With Skill Safari. The way
                  they approach the Students and clearing the doubts is so good
                  and also they provide lots of information to us regarding
                  every concept that they explain to us.They boosted up all
                  every time.Joining Skill Safari is the best thing that i made
                  in this holidays.

                  I’ve learned so much from Skill Safari.One thing that
                  impressed me about Skill Safari is if I have a question there
                  is always a quick response. Very well organized and conceived.
                  By following the course, I was able to learn and build on the
                  concepts with minimal questions or frustration. It taught me
                  what I was looking to learn, was well organized, and well
                  paced. I’m already applying what I learned.Course content are
                  Excellent,assignments that we build increase our knowledge and
                  mentoring approach was good.The instructor’s did a good job of
                  communicating and making it a more intimate arrangement.Skill
                  Safari is very good and I think it’s a very solid Company .

                  I Found the courses were quite challenging and your team was
                  always there to support and guide me. I would like to thank
                  your team . I'm happy that I have got the learning platform
                  during my 1st year of engineering. As you provide the
                  recordings it had helped me to review often

                  Skill Safari is one of the best learning platforms I've ever
                  used.I was a beginner when I joined one of the courses.I
                  wasn't very sure about joining, but my mentors made sure I
                  understood each and everything that was taught in class.The
                  online sessions are very effective and line by line
                  explanation is given for every project.The mentors can be
                  contacted any number of times regarding the doubts and they'll
                  make sure you understand everything. Individual attention is
                  given for each person and they make sure you have all the
                  resources that you need.

                  I was initially attracted here by it's Webinar and that make
                  me feel to be the part of Skill Safari further.The best thing
                  is having the freedom to think of an idea and test its
                  practical application. I feel extremely lucky to be in an
                  environment that allows me to conduct research on what
                  interests me the most, so in all my time here I have never
                  felt bored. So, I joined the program of Front-End Developer
                  .The sessions were interactive and interesting. They usemany
                  innovative ways of evaluation.I have established my
                  leadership, time management and team skills and have also been
                  able to advance these skills to whole new augment level by
                  completing it.

                  It was a wonderful experience when doing my course in
                  skillsafari. I'm the person who have more interest learn
                  website development. I taught that choosing Skillsafari for my
                  training is the best decision. The way of explanation for each
                  and every skills and tasks are crystal clear. Not only they
                  give the skills knowledge also explained the importance and
                  need of web development in current as well as future. The best
                  think I ever seen in this course that there is almost 75% of
                  practical(hands-on-experience) sessions where we practically
                  done our website side by side and more number of tasks were
                  assigned for us in each and every session and lots of good
                  techniques were taught for us to build a good website, so that
                  the end of the course I felt 100% satisfaction. And now I can
                  confidentiality say that I am a good front end developer.
                  Thanks Skillsafari.
